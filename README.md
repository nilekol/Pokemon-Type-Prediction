This repo includes our project (and output decuision tree), our scraper, and our script to convert our csv of scraped contents into a MySQL database.

Our project report is combined with the project implementation itself, thus project.ipynb is both our source code/implementation and our project report. To make it more clear, it is within the project report folder.

To use the To-MySQL script, do not forget to include your username and password in the db.ini file. Otherwise, it will not be able to connect you to the MySQL servers.

when running the project.ipynb file please make sure to run these installation commands pip install -U scikit-learn
                                                                                                    python -m pip install -U matplotlib
if running the file using run all does not work, it should work if you run each cell idividually one by one.
