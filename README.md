This repo includes our project (and output decuision tree), our scraper, and our script to convert our csv of scraped contents into a MySQL database.

Our project report is combined with the project implementation itself, thus project.ipynb is both our source code/implementation and our project report.

To use the To-MySQL script, do not forget to include your username and password in the db.ini file. Otherwise, it will not be able to connect you to the MySQL servers.
